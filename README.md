# Hotel Bookings Report


### Problem Statement
The hotel's analysts are seeking to develop a comprehensive analysis of hotel bookings data from the end of 2017 and 2018. The hotel owner is interested in determining the standard for his upcoming investment -  another hotel. This involves understanding the existing standards and customer behavior, identifying areas for improvement, and making informed decisions for the upcoming project.

### Data Source
Data was downloaded from Kaggle website in the form of a csv file and slightly modified. All orders from 29th February 2018 were excluded, as this data is unrealistic.
